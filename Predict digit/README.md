Digit Prediction using saved weights form Trained model
========================================================

We are using W2.npy and W3.npy (saved weights from training the model in master) to try the model predicting the digit form image of digit.

Uploading a 28*28 image with grayscale and .png format, and adding the image path to our new predict_digit.py file.

Predict_digit.py will predict the digit using the model and the uplaoded image. 

Accuracy for the digit prediction is more than 75% checked for few clicked pics. 

Two photos are added for refrence. one is 7 and other is 4.

Model is able to predict 7 but having toruble predicting image for 4.
